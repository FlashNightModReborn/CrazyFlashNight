/**
 * {@code MethodInvocationReturnListener} awaits a return value of a method invocation.
 * 
 * <p>This interface can either be instantiated directly or implemented by a class.
 * If you instantiate it directly you must overwrite the event method with an anonymous
 * function.
 *
 * <p>Note that overwriting the event method with a anonymous function is error-prone,
 * because the arguments' types and the return type are not type-checked. Instantiating
 * an interface directly is also not permitted in Flex.
 * 
 * <code>
 *   var listener:MethodInvocationReturnListener = new MethodInvocationReturnListener();
 *   listener.onReturn = function(returnInfo:MethodInvocationReturnInfo):Void) {
 *       trace("Invoked method successfully: " + returnInfo); 
 *   }
 * </code>
 * 
 * <p>Implementing the interface by a class is a much neater way. But sometimes it
 * adds unnecessary complexity.
 * 
 * <code>
 *   class MyListener implements MethodInvocationReturnListener {
 *       public function onReturn(returnInfo:MethodInvocationReturnInfo):Void {
 *           trace("Invoked method successfully: " + returnInfo); 
 *       }
 *   }
