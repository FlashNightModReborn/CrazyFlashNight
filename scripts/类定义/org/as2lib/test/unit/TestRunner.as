/**
 * {@code TestRunner} is the definition for a process that executes a {@code Test}.
 * 
 * <p>It is the internal mechianism for the execution of a {@code Test}. Any
 * {@code Test} has to refer to its {@code TestRunner}.
 * 
 * <p>Since {@code TestRunner} extends {@link Process} it is possible to add
 * all listeners for {@code Process} to a {@code TestRunner}.
 * 
 * <p>Example for adding a Listener to the execution of a {@link TestCase}:
 * <code>
 *   var testCase:TestCase = new MyTestCase();
 *   var testRunner:TestRunner = testCase.getTestRunner();
 *   
 *   // add a listener to log the events of the test
 *   testRunner.addListener(new LoggerTestListener());
 *   
 *   // start the execution of the testcase
 *   testCase.run();
 * </code>
 * 
 * <p>{@code TestRunner} is part of the unit testing MVC construct. {@code TestRunner}
 * acts as controller, {@link TestResult} acts as model and all listeners act
 * as view. {@code TestResult} can be accessed by {@code #getTestResult}.
 * 
 * <p>The seperation of {@code Test} & {@code TestRunner} is to save the developer
 * of a {@code TestCase} that contains all its execution details (can lead to
 * many reserved fields that might be used by the unit-test developer. In this way
 * only two fields ((@link Test#getTestRunner} & {@link Test#run}) are reserved.
