/**
 * {@code Iterator} is used to iterate over data holders.
 *
 * <p>An iterator is quite simple to use. There is one method to check whether there
 * are more elements left to iterate over {@link #hasNext}, one method to get the
 * next element {@link #next} and one to remove the current element {@link #remove}.
 * 
 * <p>Example:
 * <code>
 *   var iterator:Iterator = new MyIterator("value1", "value2", "value3");
 *   while (iterator.hasNext()) {
 *       trace(iterator.next());
 *   }
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>Output:
 * <pre>
 *   value1
 *   value2
 *   value3
 * </pre>
