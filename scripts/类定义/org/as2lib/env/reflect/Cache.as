/**
 * Cache chaches classes and packages.
 *
 * <p>The caching of classes and packages leads to better performance. You also
 * must cache them because for example the parent of two classes residing in the
 * same package should be the same {@code PackageInfo} instance.
 * 
 * <p>The cache is mostly used internally. But you can also use it to add
 * {@code ClassInfo} or {@code PackageInfo} instances directly so that they do not
 * have to be searched for. This can improve the performance dramatically with
 * classes or packages that are needed quite often.
