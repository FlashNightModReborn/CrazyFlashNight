/**
 * {@code MethodInvocationErrorListener} awaits an error response of a method
 * invocation.
 * 
 * <p>When and why the event method is invoked depends on the used client.
 *
 * <p>This interface can either be instantiated directly or implemented by a class.
 * If you instantiate it directly you must overwrite the event methods with
 * anonymous function.
 *
 * <p>Note that overwriting the event method with a anonymous function is error-prone,
 * because the arguments' types and the return type are not type-checked. Instantiating
 * an interface directly is also not permitted in Flex.
 * 
 * <code>
 *   var listener:MethodInvocationErrorListener = new MethodInvocationErrorListener();
 *   listener.onError = function(errorInfo:MethodInvocationErrorInfo):Void {
 *       trace("Error occured when trying to invoke the method: " + errorInfo);
 *   }
 * </code>
 * 
 * <p>Implementing the interface by a class is a much neater way, but sometimes adds
 * unnecessary complexity.
 *
 * <code>
 *   class MyListener implements MethodInvocationErrorListener {
 *       public function onError(errorInfo:MethodInvocationErrorInfo):Void {
 *           trace("Error occured when trying to invoke the method: " + errorInfo);
 *       }
 *   }
 * </code>
