/**
 * {@code BasicInterface} is the basic interface for each class in the As2lib
 * Framework.
 * 
 * <p>It is recommended to always implement this interface in the classes of your
 * own project but it is not a necessity. You can use all functionalities of the
 * As2lib Framework without implementing it.
 * 
 * <p>It enables you to call the {@link #toString} method on instances that have
 * been casted to interfaces.
 * 
 * <p>The default implementation {@code BasicClass} offers an enhanced {@code toString}
 * method implementation that returns a better string representation than the default
 * {@code Object#toString} method of Flash.
