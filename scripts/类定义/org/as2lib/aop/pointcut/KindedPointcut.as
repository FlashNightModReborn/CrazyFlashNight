/**
 * {@code KindedPointcut} represents any kinded pointcuts. These are for example
 * execution, set and get access pointcuts.
 * 
 * <p>Kinded pointcuts build upon a join point pattern and a specific join point type.
 * Pre-defined join point types are {@link AbstractJoinPoint#METHOD},
 * {@link AbstractJoinPoint#PROPERTY}, {@link AbstractJoinPoint#GET_PROPERTY},
 * {@link AbstractJoinPoint#SET_PROPERTY} and {@link AbstractJoinPoint#CONSTRUCTOR}.
 * You may combine several join point types with a bitwise or "|" to make this kinded
 * pointcut match all the combined join point types.
 * 
 * <p>The pattern may consist of wildcards. Using wildcards you can capture join points
 * based on specific characteristics like capture every setter method contained in every
 * class whose name starts with {@code "Abstract"} in the {@code org.as2lib.env} package
 * and every sub-package. Such a pattern would look something like this:
 * <code>org.as2lib.env..Abstract*.set*</code>
 * 
 * <p>You already see two wildcards there: '*' and '..'.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>'*' indicates any number of characters excluding the period.</li>
 *   <li>'..' indicates any number of charecters including all periods.</li>
 *   <li>'+' indicates all subclasses or subinterfaces of a given type.</li>
 *   <li>
 *     '!' negates the match; match all join points except the ones that match the
 *     pattern.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
