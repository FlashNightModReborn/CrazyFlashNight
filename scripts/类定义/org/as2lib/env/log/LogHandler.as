 * output console and so on.
 *
 * <p>The As2lib supports a hand full of different output formats. Take a look at
 * the {@code org.as2lib.env.log.handler} package to see which are supported.
 *
 * <p>A logger does not have to support the feature of adding custom handlers. It
 * is not prescribed by the {@code Logger} interface so it depends on specific
 * implementations. Mostly 'speed' loggers do not use this approach because it
 * slows the whole logging process a little bit down.
