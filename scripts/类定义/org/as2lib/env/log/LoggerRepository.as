/**
 * {@code LoggerRepository} is used to obtain {@code Logger} instances.
 *
 * <p>What logger instances are returned and how they are organized depends on the
 * specific implementation.
 * 
 * <p>There are simple implementations that just always returns instances of the
 * same class that are configured with the passed-in name.
 *
 * <p>Other implementations organize the loggers in a more complex way like in a
 * hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>All implementations have their strengths and weaknesses. In most cases you
 * have to decide between performance and functionality, like ease of configuration.
 * Take a look at the {@code org.as2lib.env.log.repository} package on what logger
 * repositories are supported.
 *
 * <p>When working with logger repositories you normally store them in the log
 * manager using the static {@link LogManager#setLoggerRepository} method. You can
 * then use the static {@link LogManager#getLogger} method to obtain loggers from
 * the set repository.
