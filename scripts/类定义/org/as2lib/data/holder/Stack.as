/**
 * {@code Stack} is the base interface for data holders that follow the 'last-in,
 * first-out' policy.
 * 
 * <p>It offers the opposite functionality of a queue, which follows the 'first-in,
 * first-out' policy.
 *
 * <p>'last-in, first-out' means that the last value that has been pushed to the
 * stack is the first that is popped from the stack.
 *
 * <p>The usage of a stack is quite simple. You have one method to push values,
 * {@link #push}, and one method to pop values, {@link #pop}. You can also peek at
 * the top of the stack to see what's the last value that has been pushed to the
 * stack without removing it {@link #peek}.
 * 
 * <p>If you want to iterate over the values of the stack you can either use the
 * iterator returned by the {@link #iterator} method or the array that contains the
 * stack's values returned by the {@link #toArray} method.
 * 
 * <p>The two methods {@link #isEmpty} and {@link #size} let you find out whether
 * the stack contains values and how many values it contains.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 * <code>
 *   // the stack gets set up
 *   var stack:Stack = new MyStack();
 *   stack.push("value1");
 *   stack.push("value2");
 *   stack.push("value3");
 *   // the stack gets used somewhere in your application
 *   trace(stack.peek()); // traces the last element without removing it
 *   while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
 *       trace(stack.pop());
 *   }
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>Output:
 * <pre>
 *   value3
 *   value3
 *   value2
 *   value1
 * </pre>
