/**
 * {@code Queue} is the base interface for data holders that follow the 'first-in,
 * first-out' policy.
 * 
 * <p>It offers the opposite functionality of a stack which follows the 'last-in,
 * first-out' policy.
 * 
 * <p>'first-in, first-out' means that the first value that has been enqueued/added
 * to the queue is the first that gets dequeued/removed.
 * 
 * <p>The usage of a queue is quite simple. You have one method to add/enqueue values
 * {@link #enqueue} and one method to remove/dequeue them {@link #dequeue}. You can
 * also peek at the beginning of the queue to see what value has been added/enqueued
 * at first without removing it {@link #peek}.
 *
 * <p>If you want to iterate over the values of the queue you can either use the
 * iterator returned by the {@link #iterator} method or the array that contains the
 * queue's values returned by the {@link #toArray} method.
 * 
 * <p>The two methods {@link #isEmpty} and {@link #size} let you find
 * out whether the queue contains values and how many values it contains.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 * <code>
 *   // the queue gets set up
 *   var queue:Queue = new MyQueue();
 *   queue.enqueue("value1");
 *   queue.enqueue("value2");
 *   queue.enqueue("value3");
 *   // the queue gets used somewhere in your application
 *   trace(queue.peek()); // traces the first element without removing it
 *   while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
 *       trace(queue.dequeue());
 *   }
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>Output:
 * <pre>
 *   value1
 *   value1
 *   value2
 *   value3
 * </pre>
